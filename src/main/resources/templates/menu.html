            <p class="lead">The Day-Ahead Market is a single pan-European energy trading platform in the ex-ante time
                frame for
                scheduling bids and offers and interconnector flows across participating regions and power exchanges
                within
                Europe.</p>
            <div class="col-sm-5 col-xs-5">
                <h4 class="display-4">Rules of the game</h4>
                <p>A product x QU (quantity units) will be auctioned under 2 parties. The parties have each y MU
                    (monetary
                    units)
                    for auction. They offer then simultaneously an arbitrary number of its MU on the first 2 QU of the
                    product.
                    After that, the bids will be visible to both. The 2 QU of the product is awarded to who has offered
                    the
                    most MU;
                    if both bid the same, then both get 1 QU. Both bidders must pay their amount - including the
                    defeated. A
                    bid of
                    0 MU is allowed. Bidding on each 2 QU is repeated until the supply of x QU is fully auctioned. Each
                    bidder aims
                    to get a larger amount than its competitor. In an auction wins the party that is able to get more QU
                    than the
                    other. With a tie, the program that retains more MU wins.</p>
